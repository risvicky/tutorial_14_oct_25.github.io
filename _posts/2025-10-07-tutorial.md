The objective of this tutorial is to perform molecular dynamics simulation using open-source software GROMACS to study the solvation of carbon dioxide (CO~2~) in water.

The tutorial will guide you through the steps of setting up the simulation, adding species to the system and solvating it with water.
It will also introduce key points in MD simulation e.g. energy minimization, energy minimization, thermostating, and both *NVT* and *NPT* equilibration steps.

## Molecular Dynamics Simulation Steps
The following steps will be covered in this tutorial:
1. **Preparation of the System**: Setting up the initial configuration of CO<sub>2</sub> in a water box.
2. **Setting Up the Simulation Parameters**: Defining the force field and simulation parameters.
3. **Energy Minimization**: Performing energy minimization to relax the system.
4. **Equilibration**: Running equilibration steps under *NVT* and *NPT* ensembles.
5. **Production Run**: Conducting the main simulation to collect data for analysis.
6. **Analysis**: Analyzing the results to understand the solvation of CO<sub>2</sub> in water.

## Setting Up GROMACS environment
Make sure you can run GROMACS commands in your terminal. Load GROMACS by typing the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   module load gromacs/intel-2022.2/2022.1-single
    gmx --version
    gmx
   ```
   If this result appears,
   ```bash
    gmx
    -bash: gmx: command not found
   ```
   you need to do,
   ```bash
    source /usr/local/gromacs/bin/GMXRC
    gmx
   ```
   


## Preparation of the System
Let us create a new directory for MD simulation files.
   ```bash
   mkdir co2_solvation
   cd co2_solvation
   ```
We will make an empty box by creating an empty file called `empty.gro`.
   ```bash
   touch empty.gro
   nedit empty.gro
   ```
Then, we will create a box with a size of 10 nm x 10 nm x 10 nm by copying and pasting the following lines into `empty.gro`.
   ```
    Cubic box
    0
    10.00000   10.00000   10.00000
   ```
The first line, `Cubic box`, is a comment line; the second line, `0`, indicates that there are no atoms in the box; and the third line specifies the dimensions of the box in nanometers, 10 nm in each direction (x, y, z). This ***.gro*** is written in [Gromos87](https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/gro.html) format. 

Next, we will add a CO~2~ molecule to the box using the `insert-molecules` command.
   ```bash
   gmx insert-molecules -f empty.gro -ci co2.gro -nmol 1 -o co2_in_box.gro
   ```
